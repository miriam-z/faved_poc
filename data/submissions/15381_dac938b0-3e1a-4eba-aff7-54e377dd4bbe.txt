"**Part one of the script is at the beginning of the video.**

Let's have a look at the design inspiration for this project and my long to-do list. I'll also share how I stay organised while managing multiple projects at once.

Milanote intro 
For this project, I'm using Milanote. Milanote is such a handy tool for organising creative work. It lets me keep everything in one place, from notes and to-do lists to images, links, and files. I can save inspiration from the web and move things around on the board however I like.

It's great for getting a clear visual overview of a project, and if you're working with a team, you can collaborate in real time, too. It's really intuitive, very user-friendly, and easy to jump in and start organising. 

I find it super helpful in keeping all my ideas and tasks in check, especially when I've got multiple projects on the go.

Let me show you my board for the hallway. I've added inspiration and product images, saved links, and made a list of everything I need to order.
I've also got my drawing with the stair measurements, and it's all in one place and super easy to find. No more cluttered pages all over my desk! I love how everything for my project stays organised in one spot.

*Talk through the design elements of the projects, chat about how you can use Milanote as a mood board initially, and then you can layer on to the board with to-do lists, comments, etc. 

Call to action 

Starting a new project can feel overwhelming, but Milanote makes it easy with over 100 built-in templates for all kinds of creative projects.  

It's perfect for creative projects; whether you're a filmmaker, interior designer, writer, or content creator, Milanote is designed to help you stay organised and keep everything in one place.  

And the best part? It's free to use with no time limit! You can sign up for a free Milanote account using the link in the description.

**Part two of the script, share before sharing the progress of the project.**

Let's revisit the project and see what tasks I can tick off my to-do list and if there is anything new, I can add to my project board. 

I will go through the progress and then share my other Milanote boards. ( I have an audience that loves gardening, so I want to share my garden boards to give them ideas on how they can use Milanote for their non-home projects) 

Add call to action

Don't forget that Milanote is free to use and has no time limit!
